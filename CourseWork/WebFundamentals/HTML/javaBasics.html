          <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language, JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is small and lightweight langauge allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Variable Declaration</u> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you can fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
            <li><u>Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operatorss assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our vaiable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a vaiable. <span>var x = 10;</span></li>
            <li><u>Data Types</u> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primatives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
